## 📋 Step-by-Step Testing

### Step 1: Open Browser DevTools
1. Press **F12** to open DevTools
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. **Keep it open** while testing

### Step 2: Create a Test
1. Go to `http://localhost:8083/`
2. Click "Create Test"
3. Add a simple question (e.g., "What is 2+2?")
4. Click "Create Test"
5. **Copy the test code** (e.g., ABC123)

### Step 3: Take the Test
1. Go to `http://localhost:8083/`
2. Click "Take Test"
3. Enter your name (e.g., "John Doe")
4. Enter the test code
5. Click "Validate Test Code"

### Step 4: Enable Camera
1. You should see a camera permission prompt
2. **Click "Allow"** to enable camera
3. You should see your webcam feed
4. Click "Start Session"

### Step 5: Start Test
1. Click "Start Test" button
2. **Watch the console** - you should see:
   ```
   Recording effect triggered: { shouldRecord: true, hasStream: true, isRecording: false }
   🎥 Starting recording...
   ✅ Video recording started
   ```

### Step 6: Answer Question
1. Answer the question
2. Click "Next" or "Submit Test"

### Step 7: Submit Test
1. Click "Submit Test" button
2. **Watch the console** - you should see:
   ```
   Stopping recording before submission...
   ⏹️ Stopping recording...
   Recording stopped, blob size: [NUMBER]
   💾 Saving recording to IndexedDB...
   saveToIndexedDB called with key: recording_[TIMESTAMP]
   Recorded chunks count: [NUMBER]
   Saving video to IndexedDB. Blob size: [NUMBER] bytes
   IndexedDB opened successfully
   Putting record: recording_[TIMESTAMP] Size: [NUMBER]
   ✅ Video saved to IndexedDB: recording_[TIMESTAMP] Size: [NUMBER]
   Recording save result: ✅ SUCCESS
   ```

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Success Indicators
- Console shows "✅ Video recording started"
- Console shows "Recording stopped, blob size: [NUMBER > 0]"
- Console shows "✅ Video saved to IndexedDB"
- Console shows "Recording save result: ✅ SUCCESS"

### ❌ Failure Indicators
- Console shows "❌ Failed to start recording"
- Console shows "⚠️ Recording blob is empty or null"
- Console shows "❌ Error saving to IndexedDB"
- Console shows "Recording save result: ❌ FAILED"

## 🧪 Console Messages Explained

### Recording Start
```
🎥 Starting recording...
✅ Video recording started
```
**Means**: Recording started successfully

### Recording Stop
```
⏹️ Stopping recording...
Recording stopped, blob size: 2500000
```
**Means**: Recording stopped and has data (size > 0)

### Saving to IndexedDB
```
💾 Saving recording to IndexedDB...
saveToIndexedDB called with key: recording_1234567890
Recorded chunks count: 45
Saving video to IndexedDB. Blob size: 2500000 bytes
IndexedDB opened successfully
Putting record: recording_1234567890 Size: 2500000
✅ Video saved to IndexedDB: recording_1234567890 Size: 2500000
```
**Means**: Recording was successfully saved to IndexedDB

## 🔎 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "❌ Failed to start recording"
**Cause**: Browser doesn't support MediaRecorder or camera not available
**Solution**:
- Try different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Check camera permissions
- Restart browser

### Issue 2: "⚠️ Recording blob is empty or null"
**Cause**: Recording didn't capture any data
**Solution**:
- Make sure camera was enabled
- Test duration was too short
- Try again with longer test

### Issue 3: "❌ Error saving to IndexedDB"
**Cause**: IndexedDB storage issue
**Solution**:
- Clear browser cache
- Check storage quota
- Try different browser

### Issue 4: Recording saved but not appearing in Recordings page
**Cause**: Recordings page not loading data correctly
**Solution**:
- Go to `/debug` page to verify recording exists
- Click "Refresh" button on Recordings page
- Check browser console for errors
