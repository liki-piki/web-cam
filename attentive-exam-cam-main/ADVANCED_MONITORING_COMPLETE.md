## 📊 Features Overview

### Attention Score
- **Calculation**: Based on head pose (yaw, pitch, roll)
- **Range**: 0-100%
- **Update Frequency**: Every 500ms
- **Display**: Large number + progress bar

### Focus Levels
| Level | Score | Color | Meaning |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Focused | 70-100% | Green | Looking at screen |
| Distracted | 40-69% | Amber | Looking away slightly |
| Away | 0-39% | Red | Not looking at screen |

### Alert Types
| Alert | Trigger | Severity |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Looking Away | Head turned > 75° | High |
| Distraction | Head turned 45-75° | Medium |
| Device Detected | Phone/Tablet visible | High |
| Multiple Faces | More than one face | High |
| No Face | Face not detected | High |

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Attention Scoring Algorithm
```
Score = 100 * (1 - avgPenalty)

Penalties:
- Yaw penalty = |yaw| / 90
- Pitch penalty = |pitch| / 90
- Roll penalty = |roll| / 45
- Average penalty = (yaw + pitch + roll) / 3
```

### Data Structures
```typescript
// Attention Metrics
{
  focusScore: number;
  headPose: { yaw, pitch, roll };
  isLookingAtScreen: boolean;
  isDistracted: boolean;
  isLookingAway: boolean;
  timestamp: number;
}

// Alert Event
{
  type: 'distraction' | 'looking_away' | 'device_detected';
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  message: string;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

## 🎨 UI Components

### Attention Monitor Card

- Average score (60-second window)
- Score progress bar
- Status indicators
- Alert history (last 5 alerts)

### Monitoring Dashboard

<AttentionMonitor
  videoRef={videoRef}
  isActive={isTestStarted}
  onAlertGenerated={(alert) => {
    // Handle alert
  }}
  onMetricsUpdate={(metrics) => {
    // Update metrics
  }}
/>
```
