# Camera & Session Setup - Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Implemented

A mandatory pre-test setup screen that requires students to:
1. ✅ Enable and verify their camera is working
2. ✅ Start the session monitoring timer
3. ✅ Only then can they begin the test

---

## Changes Made

### File Modified: `/src/pages/TakeTest.tsx`

#### New State Variables
```typescript
const [testCodeEntered, setTestCodeEntered] = useState(false);
const [sessionStarted, setSessionStarted] = useState(false);
const [sessionElapsed, setSessionElapsed] = useState(0);
```

#### New Functions
- `handleValidateTestCode()` - Validates test code and transitions to setup
- `handleStartTest()` - Updated to validate camera and session before starting

#### New UI Screen
- **Setup Screen** with two columns:
  - Left: Camera setup with live feed
  - Right: Session monitoring with controls
  - Bottom: Start Test button (disabled until both are ready)

#### Screen Flow
```

## Features

### Camera Validation
✅ Live camera feed display
✅ Real-time camera status detection
✅ Visual feedback (checkmark when ready)
✅ Error messages if camera not available
✅ Prevents test start without camera

### Session Validation
✅ Session start button
✅ Elapsed time display
✅ Real-time session status
✅ Visual feedback (checkmark when active)
✅ Prevents test start without session

### User Experience
✅ Clear instructions for each step
✅ Visual status indicators (red/green)
✅ Helpful error messages
✅ Back button to return to entry
✅ Test information display (duration, questions, points)

### Security
✅ Camera must be active before test
✅ Session must be started before test
✅ Both must be verified before proceeding
✅ Monitoring starts from test beginning
✅ Complete audit trail from setup

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: Entry
Student enters name and test code, clicks "Next: Setup Camera & Session"

### Step 2: Setup
- Camera automatically starts
- Student clicks "Start Session"
- Both show "Ready" status with checkmarks

### Step 3: Verification
- System checks: `cameraActive === true`
- System checks: `sessionStarted === true`
- "Start Test" button becomes enabled

### Step 4: Test Begins
- Test timer starts
- Monitoring is active
- Student answers questions

---

## Code Changes Summary

### Before
```typescript
const handleStartTest = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  // Validate code
  // Start test immediately
};
```

### After
```typescript
const handleValidateTestCode = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  // Validate code
  // Show setup screen
};

const handleStartTest = () => {
  // Validate camera is active
  // Validate session is started
  // Start test only if both are true
};
```

---

## Testing Results

✅ Entry form works correctly
✅ Setup screen displays properly
✅ Camera status updates in real-time
✅ Session status updates when button clicked
✅ Start Test button disabled when camera off
✅ Start Test button disabled when session not started
✅ Start Test button enabled when both active
✅ Test starts correctly after setup
✅ Back button returns to entry form
✅ Toast notifications show for errors
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ Hot reload works properly

- Camera must be on from the start
- No time to set up unauthorized materials

✅ **Ensures Monitoring**
- Session timer starts before test
- Continuous monitoring throughout

✅ **Accountability**
- Students know they're being monitored
- Creates deterrent for academic dishonesty

✅ **Complete Records**
- Session time matches test time
- Full monitoring from start to finish

---

## User Experience Improvements

---

## Deployment Notes

### No Backend Changes Required
- All changes are frontend only
- Uses existing localStorage
- No new API endpoints needed
- No database changes

### No Dependencies Added
- Uses existing React components
- Uses existing UI library
- No new npm packages

### Backward Compatible
- Existing tests still work
- Existing submissions still work
- Can be rolled back if needed

---

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add camera quality check
- [ ] Add microphone verification
- [ ] Add internet connection test
- [ ] Add system requirements check
- [ ] Add practice mode before test
- [ ] Add setup tutorial video
- [ ] Add accessibility improvements
- [ ] Add multiple language support

---

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert to the old behavior:

1. Open `/src/pages/TakeTest.tsx`
2. Remove lines 282-484 (setup screen)
3. Restore old `handleStartTest()` function
4. Remove new state variables (lines 30-32)
5. Update screen flow logic
