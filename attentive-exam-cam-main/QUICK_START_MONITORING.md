## 🚨 Common Issues

### Issue: Attention monitor not showing
**Solution**: Make sure test is started (click "Start Test")

### Issue: Score always 100%
**Solution**: This is demo mode - real ML integration needed

### Issue: No alerts appearing
**Solution**: Alerts only appear when score drops significantly

### Issue: Dashboard shows no sessions
**Solution**: This is mock data - real backend integration needed

---

## 📈 Demo Data

### Mock Sessions
The monitoring dashboard includes 3 mock sessions:
1. **John Doe** - Focused (85% score)
2. **Jane Smith** - Distracted (45% score)
3. **Bob Wilson** - Focused (92% score)

Click on any session to see details.

## 🔌 Integration Points

### For Real ML Models
1. Replace `detectHeadPose()` in AttentionMonitor.tsx
2. Replace `detectDevices()` in AttentionMonitor.tsx
3. Use MediaPipe for pose detection
4. Use COCO-SSD for device detection

### For Backend Integration
1. Send metrics to `/api/metrics`
2. Send alerts to `/api/alerts`
3. Store session data
4. Generate reports
