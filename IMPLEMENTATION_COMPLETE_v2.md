## 📋 Implementation Details

### Auto-Submit Feature

**How It Works**:
1. WebcamMonitor continuously samples video frames (every 300ms)
2. Analyzes brightness and uniformity to detect coverage
3. After 3 consecutive bad samples (~900ms), triggers auto-submit
4. Test automatically submits with a notification

**Detection Thresholds**:
- Dark Threshold: 40 (brightness)
- Low Std Threshold: 12 (uniformity)
- High Std Threshold: 80 (contrast)
- Required Samples: 3 (~900ms)

**File Modified**: `src/pages/TakeTest.tsx`

```typescript
const handleCameraChange = (active: boolean, reason?: string) => {
  setCameraActive(active);
  if (!active && isTestStarted && !isTestSubmitted) {
    const reasonMessage = reason === 'camera_covered' 
      ? 'Camera was covered during the test.' 
      : 'Camera was turned off during the test.';
    
    toast({
      title: "Test Ended - Camera Issue",
      description: `${reasonMessage} Your test has been automatically submitted.`,
      variant: "destructive",
    });
    
    handleSubmitTest();
  }
};
```
