# Dashboard Implementation & Camera Coverage Auto-Submit Feature

## Overview
This document outlines the recent enhancements to the ExamGuard system:
1. **Auto-Submit on Camera Coverage** - Tests automatically end when camera is covered
2. **Results Dashboard** - New dedicated page to view all test submissions
3. **Navigation Updates** - Improved routing and user flow

---

## 1. Auto-Submit on Camera Coverage ✅

### What Changed
When a student's camera is covered or turned off during a test, the test now **automatically submits** instead of just showing a warning.

### Implementation Details

**File: `src/pages/TakeTest.tsx`**

```typescript
const handleCameraChange = (active: boolean, reason?: string) => {
  setCameraActive(active);
  if (!active && isTestStarted && !isTestSubmitted) {
    // Camera turned off or covered during test - automatically submit
    const reasonMessage = reason === 'camera_covered' 
      ? 'Camera was covered during the test.' 
      : 'Camera was turned off during the test.';
    
    toast({
      title: "Test Ended - Camera Issue",
      description: `${reasonMessage} Your test has been automatically submitted.`,
      variant: "destructive",
    });
    
    // Automatically submit the test
    handleSubmitTest();
  }
};
```

### How It Works
1. **WebcamMonitor** continuously samples video frames (every 300ms)
2. Detects camera coverage by analyzing:
   - **Brightness levels** (dark/covered camera)
   - **Standard deviation** (uniform colors like hand or cloth)
3. After 3 consecutive bad samples (~900ms), triggers `onCameraChange(false, 'camera_covered')`
4. **TakeTest** component receives the event and automatically calls `handleSubmitTest()`
5. Student sees a toast notification explaining why the test ended

### Detection Thresholds
- **Dark Threshold**: 40 (brightness level)
- **Low Std Threshold**: 12 (uniform color detection)
- **High Std Threshold**: 80 (high contrast detection)
- **Required Consecutive Samples**: 3 (~900ms)

## 2. Results Dashboard ✅

### New Files Created

**File: `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`**
- Displays all test submissions in a table format
- Shows student name, test code, score, percentage, and status
- Allows viewing detailed submission information
- Supports deleting submissions
- Export results to CSV

### Features

#### Main Dashboard View
- **Table Display**: All submissions with key metrics
- **Pass/Fail Status**: Color-coded badges (green for pass ≥60%, red for fail)
- **Export CSV**: Download all results as CSV file
- **View Details**: Click any submission to see full details

#### Submission Details View
- **Score Breakdown**: Total score, percentage, pass/fail status
- **Answer Details**: Each question with student's answer and correctness
- **Points Earned**: Shows points for each question
- **Delete Option**: Remove individual submissions

### Data Storage
- Uses browser's **localStorage** for persistence
- All submissions stored in `examguard_submissions` key
- Data persists across browser sessions

## 3. Navigation & Routing Updates ✅

### Route Changes

**File: `src/App.tsx`**

```typescript
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />      {/* NEW: Results Dashboard */}
  <Route path="/monitor" element={<Index />} />            {/* MOVED: Monitoring demo */}
  <Route path="/create-test" element={<CreateTest />} />
  <Route path="/take-test" element={<TakeTest />} />
  <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
</Routes>
```

### Home Page Updates

**File: `src/pages/Home.tsx`**

Added new **Results Dashboard** card to the home page:
- Icon: BarChart3 (chart icon)
- Title: "Results Dashboard"
- Description: View all test submissions and analytics
- Features listed:
  - View all submissions
  - Export results to CSV
  - Detailed analytics

### TakeTest Page Updates

**File: `src/pages/TakeTest.tsx`**

Changed button text from "View Dashboard" to "View Results" for clarity.

---

## 4. Storage Functions Added ✅

### File: `src/lib/testStorage.ts`

Added new functions:

```typescript
// Get all submissions (alias for getAllSubmissions)
export const getSubmissions = (): TestSubmission[] => {
  return getAllSubmissions();
};

// Delete a submission by test code and student name
export const deleteSubmission = (testCode: string, studentName: string): boolean => {
  const submissions = getAllSubmissions();
  const filtered = submissions.filter(s => !(s.testCode === testCode && s.studentName === studentName));
  
  if (filtered.length < submissions.length) {
    localStorage.setItem(SUBMISSIONS_STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(filtered));
    return true;
  }
  return false;
};

// Export type alias
export type Submission = TestSubmission;
```
