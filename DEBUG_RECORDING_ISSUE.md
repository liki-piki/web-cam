# Debug Recording Issue - Complete Guide

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

I've identified and fixed the recording save issue:

### Problem
Recording was not being saved to IndexedDB properly because:
1. `recordedChunks` was being cleared too early
2. `saveToIndexedDB` was called but chunks were already empty

### Solution
1. Modified `stopRecording()` to NOT clear chunks immediately
2. Modified `saveToIndexedDB()` to clear chunks AFTER successful save
3. Added better logging to track the recording flow
4. Added blob size validation before saving

## 🧪 How to Test Recording Now

### Step 1: Open Browser DevTools
1. Press **F12** to open DevTools
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Keep it open while testing

### Step 2: Create a Test
1. Go to `http://localhost:8083/`
2. Click **"Create Test"**
3. Add a simple question
4. Click **"Create Test"**
5. **Copy the test code**

### Step 3: Take Test and Watch Console
1. Click **"Take Test"**
2. Enter name and test code
3. Click **"Validate Test Code"**
4. **Enable camera** when prompted
5. Click **"Start Test"**

**Watch the console for these messages:**
```
Video recording started
```

6. Answer the question
7. Click **"Submit Test"**

**Watch the console for these messages:**
```
Recording stopped, blob size: [SIZE_IN_BYTES]
Saving recording to IndexedDB...
Video saved to IndexedDB: recording_[TIMESTAMP] Size: [SIZE_IN_BYTES]
Recording save result: true
```

### Step 4: Check Recordings Page
1. Go to `http://localhost:8083/`
2. Click **"Video Recordings"**
3. **Your recording should appear!**

## 📊 Console Messages Explained

### When Recording Starts
```
Video recording started
```
✅ Recording is active

### When Recording Stops
```
Recording stopped, blob size: 1234567
Recorded chunks count: 45
```
✅ Recording stopped and has data

### When Saving to IndexedDB
```
Saving recording to IndexedDB...
Saving video to IndexedDB. Blob size: 1234567 bytes
Video saved to IndexedDB: recording_1234567890 Size: 1234567
Recording save result: true
```
✅ Recording saved successfully

### If Something Goes Wrong
```
Recording stopped, blob size: 0
No recorded data to save
```
❌ Recording is empty - camera might not have been enabled

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### Issue 1: Recording Not Appearing

**Check Console for:**
1. "Video recording started" - Did it appear?
2. "Recording stopped, blob size:" - What's the size?
3. "Video saved to IndexedDB" - Did it save?

**If blob size is 0:**
- Camera was not enabled during test
- Try again with camera enabled

**If save failed:**
- Check browser IndexedDB quota
- Try clearing cache
- Try different browser

### Issue 2: Check IndexedDB Directly

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Expand **IndexedDB**
4. Look for **ExamGuardDB**
5. Expand **recordings** store
6. Should see your recording with key like `recording_1234567890`

### Issue 3: Verify Recording Data

In DevTools Console, run:
```javascript
const request = indexedDB.open('ExamGuardDB', 1);
request.onsuccess = () => {
  const db = request.result;
  const transaction = db.transaction(['recordings'], 'readonly');
  const objectStore = transaction.objectStore('recordings');
  const getAllRequest = objectStore.getAll();
  getAllRequest.onsuccess = () => {
    console.log('All recordings:', getAllRequest.result);
  };
};
```

This will show all recordings in the console.

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No recorded data to save"
**Cause**: Recording was empty
**Solution**: 
- Make sure camera was enabled
- Check if test duration was long enough
- Try again

### Issue: "IndexedDB error"
**Cause**: Browser storage issue
**Solution**:
- Clear browser cache
- Try different browser
- Check storage quota

### Issue: Recording appears but won't play
**Cause**: Browser doesn't support WebM
**Solution**:
- Try Chrome or Firefox
- Download and play with VLC

### Issue: Blob size is 0
**Cause**: Camera not enabled or recording didn't capture
**Solution**:
- Enable camera during test
- Make sure camera is working
- Try again

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Recording Flow:
1. Test starts → `shouldRecord = true`
2. WebcamMonitor starts recording
3. `videoRecorder.startRecording(stream)` called
4. MediaRecorder captures video frames
5. Test submitted → `shouldRecord = false`
6. WebcamMonitor stops recording
7. `videoRecorder.stopRecording()` returns blob
8. `videoRecorder.saveToIndexedDB()` saves blob
9. Recording appears in Recordings page

### Key Changes Made:
1. **videoRecorder.ts**:
   - Don't clear chunks in `stopRecording()`
   - Clear chunks in `saveToIndexedDB()` after save
   - Added logging for blob size

2. **WebcamMonitor.tsx**:
   - Check blob size before saving
   - Added logging for save result
   - Better error handling

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ Console shows "Video recording started"
- ✅ Console shows blob size > 0
- ✅ Console shows "Video saved to IndexedDB"
- ✅ Console shows "Recording save result: true"
- ✅ Recording appears in Recordings page
- ✅ Can view/download/delete recording

---

## 📞 Still Not Working?

1. **Check Console** - Look for error messages
2. **Check IndexedDB** - Verify data is there
3. **Try Different Browser** - Chrome, Firefox, Edge
4. **Clear Cache** - Remove old data
5. **Check Camera** - Make sure it's working
6. **Enable Camera** - During test, not before

---

## 🎊 Next Steps

1. **Test the fix**:
   - Open DevTools
   - Create and take a test
   - Watch console messages
   - Check Recordings page

2. **If it works**:
   - Great! Recording feature is fixed
   - You can now use it normally

3. **If it doesn't work**:
   - Share console messages
   - Check IndexedDB data
   - Try different browser
